Hi [Stakeholder],

I have pulled together the data which answers your questions about the brand with the most spend and the brand with the most transactions among users created in the last 6 months.

To provide you with the most helpful information possible, I'd like to get a sense for what you are trying to understand with this information. The current result looks across all brands within consumer receipt scans, regardless of Fetch product partner status. If you are looking to understand top Fetch product partner brands, I can modify my query to provide you the correct data.

You may notice that a significant amount of spend and number of transactions are associated with "null" brands. This is because of a data issue where nearly half of products captured in the receipt scan data do not have associated brand name information. I discovered this issue while exploring item-level receipt scan data.

I believe this issue may be stemming from missing brandCode information in the brand table. The field "brandCode" is used to associate products in receipt scans with brand names, so missing data prevents joining important brand and product information with receipt scan information. We can correct this by auditing our brand data and assigning brandCode information to items with missing values and adding new items to the brand table where needed. Audits may be impractical long term, however, as item lists may grow into the hundreds of thousands. Developing a model to identify brand names from product descriptions may be more practical in the long term.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

Best,
Brendan Kenney
