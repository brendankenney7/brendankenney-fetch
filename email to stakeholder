Hi [Stakeholder],

I have pulled together the data which answers your questions regarding the top brand by spend and the top brand by transactions among users created in the last 6 months.

My data set provides a list of all brands appearing in receipt scan data, starting with the top spending brand in descending order. I have also included a field which captures the number of transactions of each brand. Please not that this does not account for the number of item sold, just the number of transactions.

I also noticed some data errors while gathering this data set. More than half of the items appearing in receipt scan data do not have an associated brand name. All spend occuring on these items are grouped under the row with a 'null' brand name. This means that there may be a different top selling brand which is not captured in the data. We could fix this issues by either expanding the brand data set to include more items and their associated brand name, or by further developing a model to interpret brand name from item descriptions.

I also found that the spend data captured within receipt scans may not always be accurate. In some cases, the total amount spent on multiple items may be over or under represented, potentially due to inconsistent calculations or representations of unit price and quantity purchased. Additionally, the data does not appear to correctly account for price discounts. These errors may cause the spend totals of some brand to be over or under represented.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

Best,
Brendan Kenney
